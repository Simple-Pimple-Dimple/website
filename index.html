          We started in late 2019, when Darius Leong had an idea for a video
          game<br />
          He contacted his friend Lucian Coveney, asking if Lucian could make
          the art<br />
          Lucian agreed, and they started development on
          <a href="worldwarthreeworldwide.html">World War Three Worldwide</a>
          <br /><br />
          Part way through development,<br />
          Darius and Lucian realised that they'd need a company to<br />
          manage the copyright between the two <br /><br />
          And so, Worldwide Studios was created
        </p>
