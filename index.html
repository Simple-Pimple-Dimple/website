          We are Worldwide Studios. Our company goal is to create games that are
          unique and different<br />

        <br />
        We started in late 2019, when Darius Leong had an idea for a video
        game<br />
        He contacted his friend Lucian Coveney, asking if Lucian could make the
        art<br />
        Lucian agreed, and they started development on World War Three Worldwide
        <br /><br />
        Part way through development,<br />
        Darius and Lucian realised that they'd need a company to<br />
        manage the copyright between the two <br /><br />
        And so, Worldwide Studios was created
      </p>
