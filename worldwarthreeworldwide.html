        World War Three Worldwide was a video game put into production by Darius
        Leong and Lucian Coveney in late 2019.<br /><br />
        So, the player would pick a country, Australia for example, and then
        they'd look like a soldier from the country they'd picked.<br />
        They'd also have the same weapons as that country issues to their
        soldiers as well.<br />
        Darius and Lucian also thought of adding a creeper that follows you
        around and helps you (a tribute to Minecraft).<br /><br />
        "I always thought of creepers being cute and sad.<br />
        I just wanted to help them, but of course they blew up before I had a
        chance." Explained Darius. "So we wanted to switch that around."<br /><br />
        Darius wrote the game in JavaScript, the only language he knew at the
        time, and Lucian drew the artwork.<br /><br />
        Sadly, Darius and Lucian pulled the plug on the project in early-ish
        2020 because it was taking too long,<br />
        and because Darius found out that game developers should always start
        with an easy project.<br /><br />
        They agreed to come back to the project after they'd established the
        business and gotten some good employees.
